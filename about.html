                  We believe in transparency as a developer. We respect your time and investment with us.
                  As such development is as much your business as it is ours. We envision frequent updates
                  through our social media pages as we make progress towards a final product we can be proud 
                  of as both developers and players. In doing so, we intend to further our connection with you, 
                  the player, and have you join us on this journey.

        <div id="mission_sect">
            <h1>About us...</h1>
            <p id="mission_statement">
                As an independent game developer made of creative minds and players alike, 
                we wish to combine our efforts into a project we can all be proud of and give our audience 
                a gaming experience worth more than the money they spent. Our mission as a united team, 
                we wish to put our own mark in the gaming world and will strive to deliver a fulfilling 
                story to accompany challenging, yet rewarding gameplay emphasizing exploration, narrative, 
                and investment. 
                <br> <br>
                Our business model comes from motivation gained from disasterous releases such as Hello Games'
                <i>No Man's Sky</i> and CD Projekt RED's <i>CyberPunk 2077</i>, as well as positive releases 
                such as Team Cherry's <i>Hollow Knight</i> and Koji Igarashi's <i>BloodStained: Ritual of the
                Night</i>. We believe a game's marketing success comes from the developer-player relationship 
                that is nurtured during development through PR and advertisement. <i>No Man's Sky</i> as well 
                as <i>CyberPunk 2077</i> both had deceptive marketing that misrepresented the product on release. 
                Not only that, but developers working on the game were mistreated and the final end product
                suffered because of it. We intend to promote honesty with our fanbase which will shinethrough in 
                developer posts and developer streams where we give updates on the game as well as respond to 
                your feedback. To further our success, we encourage you to reach out to us either through social
                media or our <a href="contact.html">contact page</a> and let us know what you think. 
                <br><br>
                This form of management and transparency is only possible due to our position of being a small 
                development team. We rely on your support, both morally and financially, in completing our projects.
                Due to our limitations, we will also encorporate crowd-funding through 
                <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/?country=US">Kickstarter</a>.
